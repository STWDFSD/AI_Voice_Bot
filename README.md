# AI_Voicebot
RASA based voice bot after 1 months jump in to AI ;)

Hello everyone, this source code I used to go to the recent AI Hackathon Hanoi test but .... no prize.

However, it solved the problem at the agency where he worked. That's okie!

According to the previous promise, I will share the source code with you guys.

I am very sorry that I cannot fully share bot data because of the company's security.

However, you can download it to get a general idea of ​​how to organize a chatbot with RASA.

You need to install packages:
- Rasa Core: pip install rasa_core
- Run train_nlu, py to train NLU
- Run train_dialog.py to train Rasa Core
- Run test_dialog.py and start chat with bot;)

In order to deploy the voice part, we have to integrate with Google API so this part of google will make it very simple!

In general, for me, how does AI solve problems in real life, but not how high-tech AI is used;)

Good luck!
